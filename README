This is a new version of former script vimscript #787.
This script scans Qt 3.x, KDE 3.x, wxWidgets, GTK 1.2.x and GTK 2.x headers, then creates vim syntax file (cType definitons for all classes/structs) for highlighting and plain list of classes for vim word-completion (for use with vimscript #213). multiAPIsyntax supports command line options like --qt, --kde, --wx, --gtk1, --gtk2, so you may choose which libraries to scan.
